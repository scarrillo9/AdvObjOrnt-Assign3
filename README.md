# CS	3331 - Assignment	3
## UML	Class	Diagram	and	State	Machine	Implementation
## Due	October	14th by	end	of	day on	Blackboard

In	this	assignment,	you	are	going	to	implement	a	UML	Class	Diagram	and a	State	
Machine	in	Java.

## Task	1:	UML	Class	Diagram	Implementation

Refer	to	the	class	diagram	at	the	end	of	this	assignment.	Implement	the	UML	Class	
Diagram	in	Java.	Your	implementation	must	cover	the	following	items.

1. Implement	the	inheritance	relationship	using	Java	extends syntax.
2. Implement attribute	visibility	operators in	Java.
3. Implement	associations	using	references.	Use	a	data	structure	(such	as	a	set)to	implement	one-to-many	associations	as	needed.
4. Implement	CalculateCombinedPrice method,	which	prints	the	combined	price	of	all	items	in	the	cart	on	the	screen.
5. Other	methods	in	the	Class	Diagram	should	print	the	method	name	on	the	screen.

In	addition,	implement	the	following	methods:

6. Within	the	cart	class,	implement	a	method	to	list	all	items	within	a	specific cart.
7. Within	a	cart,	implement	a	method	to	print	customer	name	and	customer	user	ID	on	the	screen.
8. Within	a	customer,	implement	a	method	to	list	all	credit	cards	belong	to	a	specific	customer.
9. Within	an	Item,	implement a	method	to	print	the	item	type	(book,	music	CD,	computer	software).

Submission	Guidelines

1. Java	source	code.
2. Sample	runs	of	the	code	to	show that	your	implementation	covers	each	of	the	items	above.

## Task	2:	UML	State	Machines	Implementations
### Done (Revised by Javi  and Sergio)

Refer	to	the	state	machine	diagram	at	end	of	this	assignment	and	implement	its	
behavior	in	Java.	Events	in	the	state	machine	can	be	invoked	by	the	user (and	should	
be	implemented	as	public	methods).	At	any	time,	the	user	can	query	the	current	
state	of	the	state	machine.

Submission	Guidelines

1. Java	source	code.
2. Sample	runs	showing	different	sequences	of	events	with	queries	of	current	state.

## Task	3:	Implement	3	use	cases	you	have	identified for	your	project.

Chose	three	use	cases	that	you	have	identified	for	your	project	and	implement	them	
in	Java. Include	the	implemented	use	cases	in	your	submission.
